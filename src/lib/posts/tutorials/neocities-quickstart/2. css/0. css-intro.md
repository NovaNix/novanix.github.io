CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to decorate and format your HTML. Where HTML is the contents of the page, CSS is the styling.

# Adding CSS to your page

## `<style>` Element

## External

Most of the time, your CSS is going to be in a separate file from your HTML. To include it, use the `<link>` element.

```html
<link href="/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all">
```

## Inline

You can also add CSS rules directly to individual elements. This can be done with the `style` attribute.

```html
<p style="color: blue;">I'm blue now!</p>
```

# CSS Basics

CSS is composed of two things: selectors and rules. 

*Selectors* are used to pick which HTML elements rules are applied to.

*Rules* are used to specify how things look and act.

```css
.selector {
    rule: value;
    rule-2: value2;
}
```
