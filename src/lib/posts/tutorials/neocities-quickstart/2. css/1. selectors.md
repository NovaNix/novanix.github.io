Selectors are responsible for telling the browser which elements to apply rules to!

# Elements

The selector for elements is just the element's tag.

For example, a selector for a `<p>` element is just `p`. 

```css
p {
    color: red;
}
```

# IDs

The `id` attribute assigns an element a name! This name can then be used to assign rules to it!

To select by an ID, put a `#` before the ID name

```html
<p id="id-here">This should be special!</p>
```
```css
#id-here {
    color: red;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> IDs should be unique! There should only be one element on the page with that ID.
>
> If you want to assign the same ID to multiple elements, consider using **classes** instead!

# Classes

The `class` attribute is used to assign an element to a sort of group. You can then assign rules based on classes.

```html
<p class="main-text">This is the most important part of my page!</p>
```

Each element can have more than one class! To give an element multiple classes, put a space between them!

```html
<p class="class-1 class-2">Two classes in one!</p>
```

To select based on classes, put a `.` before the class name

```html
<p class="red-text">This should be red!</p>
```
```css
.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```

# Universal Selector

In rare situations, you want a selector for *everything*. To do this, the selector is just `*`

```css
* {
    /* This applies to EVERYTHING!! */
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> This selector can be slow, and most of the time serves little purpose. Avoid it if you can!
