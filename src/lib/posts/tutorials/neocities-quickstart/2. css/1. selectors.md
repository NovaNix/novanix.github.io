# Elements

The selector for elements is just the element's tag.

For example, a selector for a `<p>` element is just `p`. 

```css
p {
    color: red;
}
```

# IDs

To select by an ID, put a `#` before the ID name

```html
<p id="id-here">This should be special!</p>
```
```css
#id-here {
    color: red;
}
```

# Classes

To select based on classes, put a `.` before the class name

```html
<p class="red-text">This should be red!</p>
```
```css
.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```
