# Colors

To change the color of the contents of an element, the `color: <color>` rule can be used.

```css
.color-me {
    color: red;
}
```

Colors can be defined in a few different ways
```css
color: red; /* Named Colors */
color: #ff0000; /* Hex Colors */
color: rgb(255, 0, 0); /* RGB Colors */
```
To see all of the available options, view the [MDN web docs page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color).

## Build-In Colors

# Backgrounds

You can also change the color of the element's background

```css
.color-me {
    background-color: red;
}
```

# Borders

You can also easily add borders to elements!

Each border needs 3 things: 
1. a `width` (thickness)
    - `border-width: <line-width>` 
2. a `style`
    - `border-style: <line-style>`
3. a `color`
    - `border-color: <color>`

There's also a shorthand for specifying all three in a single rule

`border: <line-width> <line-style> <color>`

```css
border-width: 1px;
border-style: solid;
border-color: red;

/* becomes */

border: 1px solid red;
```

## Styles

There are a number of border styles you can choose from

- none
- hidden
- dotted
- dashed
- solid
- double
- groove
- ridge
- inset
- outset

## Rounding

You can also round the corners of borders using the `border-radius: <length>` rule.

```css
border-radius: 10px;
```
