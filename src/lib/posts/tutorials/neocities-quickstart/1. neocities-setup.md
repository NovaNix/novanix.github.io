Before you can work on your website, you'll need a way to host it. For this tutorial, we'll be using [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).

# Setting up your Account

1. Go to https://neocities.org/
2. On the main page, fill out the username, password, and email address under the "Sign up for free" section. Click the "create account" button
3. Once your account is created, it should redirect you to the welcome page. Under the "free" plan section, scroll down and select the "continue" button. 
4. It should now want you to verify your email. Go to the email you signed up with, and open the email verification email. Copy the token they provided, and paste it into the confirmation box. 
5. Once youâ€™re on the page with the header "Let's Get Started!", your account is fully created. 
6. To view your site, go to YOURUSERNAME.neocities.org. It should show the default page.
