Before you can work on your website, you'll need a way to host it. For this tutorial, we'll be using [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).

# Setting up your Account

1. Go to https://neocities.org/
2. On the main page, fill out the username, password, and email address under the "Sign up for free" section. Click the "create account" button
3. Once your account is created, it should redirect you to the welcome page. Under the "free" plan section, scroll down and select the "continue" button. 
4. It should now want you to verify your email. Go to the email you signed up with, and open the email verification email. Copy the token they provided, and paste it into the confirmation box. 
5. Once youâ€™re on the page with the header "Let's Get Started!", your account is fully created. 
6. To view your site, go to YOURUSERNAME.neocities.org. It should show the default page. 

# Navigating Neocities

## Dashboard
At https://neocities.org/dashboard, you'll find all of the files that make up your site!
- `index.html` is the **contents** of the main page of your site
- `style.css` is the **styling** for your site
- `not_found.html` is the contents of the page that will be displayed when navigating to a missing page
- `neocities.png` is the **default cat picture**

## Editing Files
To edit the files that make up your site, hover over them in the dashboard and click **edit**.

This will bring up the **editor** for that file. This may be a little intimidating at first, but it's basically just a fancy text editor.

While making changes, if you make a **syntax error** (an error in how the file contents are written), a small red X will appear on the far left of the line. You can hover over it to see the error. When the error is fixed, the X will disappear. 

When you've finished making changes, click the **save** button at the top of the page. You can then click **view** to see your site!

> [!NOTE]
> It may take a little bit for your site to update when you make changes!
