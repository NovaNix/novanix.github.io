Images can be added to your site using the **image** element `<img>`

# `src` attribute

The `src` attribute is used to set the **source** of the image. This takes the form of a **url** pointing to the image you want to use!

```html
<!-- You can use absolute urls -->
<img src="https://neocities.org/img/cat.png" />

<!-- or relative urls -->
<img src="/cats.png" />
<img src="flowers.png" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> The url used should typically end in the **file extension** of the image! If not, then you might have the wrong link!

Many image formats are commonly supported, including
- `.png`
- `.apng`
- `.jpg`
- `.jpeg`
- `.gif`
- `.svg`
- `.webp`
- `.avif`

# Uploading Images to Neocities

To upload and use an image on Neocities:
1. Go to the [dashboard](https://neocities.org/dashboard)
2. Either click the "Upload" button and select your file, or drag the image on to the shaded file section

In this example, the uploaded image is "test-picture.png"
<img src="/tutorial-images/neocities-quickstart/uploaded-picture.png">

Now that it's uploaded, we need to add it to our page!

3. Edit the HTML file of the page you would like to add the image to. Add a new `<img>` element to the page
4. Set the `src` attribute to be the path of the image
	- In this case, because the image is in the **root** folder, the path is `"/test-picture.png"`
	- If the image was in a folder, it would be `"/foldername/test-picture.png"`
5. Save the file and view your site. The image should appear
