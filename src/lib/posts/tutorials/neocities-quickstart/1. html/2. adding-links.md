Hyperlinks are added to your site using the **anchor** `<a>` element.

# Making Links

1. Make a new anchor `<a>` element
2. Place the text the user will see for the link inside the open and close tags. 
3. Add a `href` attribute with the url the user will be redirected to

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">For more help, click here!</a>
```

# `href` attribute

The `href` attribute is used to set the url the user will be sent to when you click the link!

## Absolute URL

When linking to external sites, the entire URL needs to be used. 

```html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">For more help, click here!</a>
```

## Relative URLs

When linking to pages on your own site, you can use **relative** urls!

These can be a little confusing, so first lets imagine how your site is structured as a **file system**.

Let's imagine your current page is at the url `https://yoursite.com/characters/princes/red.html`

Your **origin** is `https://yoursite.com/` <br>
Your **directory** is `/characters/princes/` <br>
Your **current file** is `/characters/princes/red.html` <br>

| type | href | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| origin-relative url | `/stories` | `https://yoursite.com/stories` |
| same directory url | `./blue.html` | `https://yoursite.com/characters/blue.html` |
| parent directory url | `../` | `https://yoursite.com/characters/` |
