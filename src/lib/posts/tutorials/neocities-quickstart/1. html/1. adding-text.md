Adding text to a page is very easy. Simply place the text anywhere inside of the `<body>` element, and the text will show up on the page!

```html preview
Hello!
```

While this works, there are better options that apply additional formatting. 

# Paragraphs

The **paragraph** `<p>` element is used for paragraphs. Place the text you want to display in between the open and close tags.

```html preview
<p>This will be a paragraph!</p>
```

<CodeEditor>
<EditorTab>
<p>This will be a paragraph!</p>
</EditorTab>
</CodeEditor>

## Line Breaks

In `<p>` blocks, pressing enter to add new lines won't show up visually when displaying the HTML. To add a line break, use a **line break** `<br>` element.

```html preview
<p>This is one one,<br/>This is another</p>
```

## Horizontal Rule

To add a horizontal line between two paragraphs, the **horizontal rule** `<hr>` element can be used. 

```html preview
<p>This is paragraph one</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is paragraph two</p>
```

# Headers

To add headers to your page, the **header** elements can be used. These will be displayed as large text.

There are 6 header elements, `<h1>`-`<h6>`. `<h1>` is the largest header, progressively getting smaller as the number increases. 

```html preview
<h1>Headers!</h1>
<p>Headers are very cool!</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Pick the size you want and give it some content!</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>You need to be careful though, they're important for accessibility too!</p>
```

> [!CAUTION]
> When using headers, there are a number of accessibility concerns! They are used for navigation and by screen readers, so care should be used to ensure that you use headers correctly. Here are a quick few things to keep in mind.
> 1. Only have one `<h1>` header per page.
> 2. Don't skip header levels! If you have an `<h3>`, you need an `<h2>` and an `<h1>`.
>
> For more detailed information, please view the [MDN web docs page on headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) 

# Inline Elements

There are many HTML elements that can be placed inside of paragraphs or other blocks. These can be used to style text, such as underlining a section, or making a word bold.  

> [!NOTE]
> While these elements *can* be used for stylizing text, these elements should be used based on their *semantic* meaning instead. 
> 
> HTML is purely the content of the page. It *can* contain styling information, but for a variety of reasons, how things should be displayed should be done in CSS as much as possible. 
> Separating the content from the style means that it is easier to go back and change how things look without modifying HTML. It also makes things more clear to screen readers.
>
> All of the elements included below are fairly safe to use for stylization, but it's important to keep this in mind for the future. 

## Strong (Bold)

For text that is significant, the **strong** `<strong>` element can be used. Most browsers will display this text as <strong>bold</strong>.

```html preview
<p>Dropping a bowl at 4am is extremely <strong>loud</strong>!</p>
```

## Italics

To italicize text, the **idiomatic text** `<i>` element can be used. 

```html preview
<p>I'm <i>special</i> in some way...</p>
```

## Strikethrough

To put a line through text, use the **strikethrough** `<s>` element. This should be used for text that is no longer accurate. 

```html preview
<p><s>FRESH SHRIMP AVAILABLE</s> We Outta Shrimp</p>
```

> [!WARNING]
> The strikethrough element is often ignored by screen readers! To keep things accessible, add additional context outside of the strikethrough element. 
>
> For more information, please view the [mdn web docs page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s#accessibility)

## Span

Sometimes it is useful to have an inline element without any default styling. For this, the **span** `<span>` element can be used.

```html preview
<p>This might not <span>seem useful</span> yet.</p>
```

This element becomes very useful later when we learn styling. 

# Container Elements

## Divs

Often it is useful to have a container without any default special styling. The **content division** `<div>` element can be used for this!

> [!NOTE]
> Using CSS, you *could* use `div` elements for nearly everything. However this has serious accessibility concerns.
>
> Different container elements have different semantic meanings. These meanings are used by screen readers to detect and process information. 
> The different elements also make HTML much easier to read for developers.
