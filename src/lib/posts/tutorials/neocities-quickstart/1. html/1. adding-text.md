Adding text to a page is very easy. 

# Paragraphs

The *paragraph* `<p>` element is used for paragraphs. Place the text you want to display in between the open and close tags.

```html
<p>This will be a paragraph!</p>
```

## Line Breaks

In `<p>` blocks, pressing enter to add new lines won't show up visually when displaying the HTML. To add a line break, use a *line break* `<br>` element.

```html
<p>This is one one,<br/>This is another</p>
```

## Horizontal Rule

To add a horizontal line between two paragraphs, the *horizontal rule* `<hr>` element can be used. 

```html
<p>This is paragraph one</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is paragraph two</p>
```

# Headers

To add headers to your page, the *header* elements can be used. These will be displayed as large text.

There are 6 header elements, `<h1>`-`<h6>`. `<h1>` is the largest header, progressively getting smaller as the number increases. 

```html
<h1>Headers!</h1>
<p>Headers are very cool!</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Pick the size you want and give it some content!</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>You need to be careful though, they're important for accessibility too!</p>
```

> [!CAUTION]
> When using headers, there are a number of accessibility concerns! They are used for navigation and by screen readers, so care should be used to ensure that you use headers correctly. Here are a quick few things to keep in mind.
> 1. Only have one `<h1>` header per page.
> 2. Don't skip header levels! If you have an `<h3>`, you need an `<h2>` and an `<h1>`.
>
> For more detailed information, please view the [MDN web docs page on headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)

# Inline Elements

There are many HTML elements that can be placed inside of paragraphs or other blocks. These can be used to style text, such as underlining a section, or making a word bold.  

> [!NOTE]
> While these elements *can* be used for stylizing text, their semantic meaning is important as well. INSERT SECTION ABOUT CSS 

## Strong (Bold)

For text that is significant, the *strong* `<strong>` element can be used. Most browsers will display this text as <strong>bold</strong>.

```html
<p>Dropping a bowl at 4am is extremely <strong>loud</strong>!</p>
```
