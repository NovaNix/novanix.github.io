# HTML Reference

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the basis of your web page. It contains the raw contents of the page, such as all of the text, links, images, tables, etc. It also contains hidden links to other important resources, such as script and styling files.

## Writing HTML
HTML is very simple to write. If you've ever written any XML, this should be very familiar.

### Tags

HTML elements are composed of a *starting tag* and an *ending tag*, with some content in the middle.

```html
Starting Tag
|
V
<p>CONTENTS</p>
             ^
             |
             Ending tag
```

Some elements can be closed without an ending tag

```html
<img/>
```

### Attributes

Some elements have *attributes*. These are placed on an element like this

```html
<img src=""/>
```

Attributes are formatted as `attribute=value`. Some attributes don't take a value, which is represented like this.

```html
<input disabled/>
```

### Nesting
HTML elements can be placed in other HTML elements. To do this, simply place an HTML element inside the contents of another element.

```html
<p>It's <i>that</i> easy!</p>
```
