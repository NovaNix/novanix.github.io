<h1>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</h1>
<h3>Hello!</h3>

<p>
	If you're reading this, you've caught me in the middle of setting this site up.
	Eventually this site will be a showcase of my personal projects, along with tutorials, demos, blog posts, or whatever else I feel like making.

	For now, if you're looking for information about me, my GitHub is probably the best place to look.
